# Java


## Main
- Every java code needs a Main class

`public class Main{`

``

## Variables 
- There are two types of variables

Primitive = simple value directly in memory (stack)
- int, double, char, bool

Reference = memory address, points to the heap 
- string, array, object

### Two steps of creating a variable 
1. Declaration,
2. Assignment

##### Camel case 
- naming convention, the first letter of the multiple word variable is lower case
